                                Mouse events are a group of events that are specific to user interactions with a
                                computer mouse. They are an essential part of creating interactive web applications,
                                enabling developers to handle various actions such as clicks, double-clicks, and mouse
                                movements. Mouse events include "mousedown", "mouseup", "click", "dblclick",
                                "mousemove", "mouseover", and "mouseout", among others. These events can be used to
                                trigger specific functions or change the appearance of elements on a web page, improving
                                user experience and interactivity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="description para2">
                                Touch events are designed for handling user interactions with touchscreens, which are
                                common on smartphones and tablets. They provide a way for web developers to create
                                responsive and intuitive interfaces for touch-based devices. The main touch events
                                include "touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend", and "touchcancel". These events allow
                                developers to detect when a user touches the screen, moves their finger across the
                                screen, lifts their finger from the screen, or if the system cancels a touch event for
                                some reason. By using touch events, web applications can be adapted to work seamlessly
                                on devices with touch interfaces, providing a smooth and natural user experience.
                            </p>
                            <p class="description para3">
                                Pointer events are a more recent addition to web standards, aiming to unify mouse,
                                touch, and pen input into a single set of events. They provide a more consistent way to
                                handle different input methods and make it easier for developers to create responsive
                                web applications that work well with various devices and input types. The main pointer
                                events include "pointerdown", "pointerup", "pointermove", "pointerover", "pointerout",
                                "pointerenter", "pointerleave", and "pointercancel". By using pointer events, developers
                                can write a single set of event listeners that work for all types of input devices,
                                simplifying the code and improving the overall performance and maintainability of web
                                applications.
