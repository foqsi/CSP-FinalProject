                        <p class="description modifyText">
                            Maintaining state in web applications refers to the process of preserving data and user
                            preferences across multiple pages, sessions, or interactions. As HTTP, the protocol used for
                            the World Wide Web, is stateless by nature, additional methods are required to preserve the
                            state. These methods ensure that users have a consistent and personalized experience when
                            navigating through a website or using a web application.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description modifyText">
                            One common method to maintain state is using cookies. Cookies are small text files stored on
                            the user's device by the browser, which can hold data such as user preferences, session
                            identifiers, or authentication tokens. Web applications can read and update these cookies to
                            remember a user's actions or settings across multiple pages or visits. However, cookies have
                            some limitations, such as size constraints and privacy concerns, which led to the
                            development of alternative techniques.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description modifyText">
                            Another approach to maintaining state is utilizing session storage and local storage, which
                            are part of the Web Storage API. Session storage is used for storing data that is specific
                            to a single browsing session, and it gets deleted once the session is closed. Local storage,
                            on the other hand, persists data even after the session is closed, allowing for longer-term
                            storage. Both session storage and local storage can store larger amounts of data compared to
                            cookies and provide better security and privacy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description modifyText">
                            In addition to the client-side methods, server-side techniques can also be employed to
                            maintain state. One such method is using server-side sessions, where the user's data is
                            stored on the server and linked to the user via a unique session identifier. This identifier
                            is then passed between the server and the client, usually through cookies or URL parameters.
                            Server-side sessions can provide a higher level of security and enable the storage of
                            sensitive data, but they may require more resources and increase server load.
